##Scope

This project involves creating a simple Facebook-like wall. The objective of this project is for students to practice their jQuery skills. Unlike previous projects, this is the first time students are presented with minimal scaffolding.
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

### Starter code

See [here](starter_code/) for code and [here](https://rawgit.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/master/units/10-jquery/lessons/2-project/starter_code/index.html) to view.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions/tree/master/units/10-jquery/lessons/2-project/solution_code) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../10-jquery/lessons/1-jquery/assessments/).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance at www.kinvolved.com
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

###Opening

What is the Facebook wall? How does it work? 

Let's login to my Facebook and do a live demonstration.

###Lecture

You are going to build a simple Facebook Wall. Your instructions:

#### 1. Fill out `wall.js`

You must fill out `js/wall.js`. Unlike previous projects, there is very little starter code given. This is on purpose.

#### 2. Test

To test if your Wall works as expected, post the following messages in order: "First message", "Second message", "Third message". Afterwards, your Wall should look like:

###Brianstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. Read `index.html`. Pay attention to the IDs of the text box, button, and `div` at the bottom.
2. How will you detect the click on the "Post" button?
3. What should happen once the "Post" button is clicked? Will you need to generate HTML? 

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

Also remind students to add a link to their project on their About Me page.
